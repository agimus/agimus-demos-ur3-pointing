# Launch the camera node

0. In terminal 1, run the following command to start realsense with ros, with the option to publish the pointcloud:
```bash
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_aligned_depth.launch filters:=pointcloud
```

Check that the package ```react_inria``` is installed and go to the folder ```react_inria/launch```.

# Running react_inria localization node in simulation

1. To provide the initial pose of the part in simulation, in terminal 2, while in the  ```react_inria/launch``` folder:

```bash
roslaunch ./react_learning.launch use_sim_time:=true
```
And follow the instructions to generate a new pose and save it.

2. Run the localization node in simulation, in terminal 2:

```bash
roslaunch ./react_localizer.launch use_wMo_filename:=$HOME/.ros/transform_wMo.yaml use_oMo_filename:=$HOME/.ros/transform_oMo.yaml use_aligned_depth:=false use_sim_time:=true
```

3. In terminal 3, launch the script publishing the frame used in the demo, in `agimus-demos/script` folder:

```bash
./publish_frames.py 
```

# Running react_inria localization node on the robot

1. To provide the initial pose of the part on the real robot, in terminal 2, while in the  ```react_inria/launch``` folder:

```bash
roslaunch ./react_learning.launch use_cad_model_filename:=/root/devel/src/react_inria/config/Plaque-UR3.react
```
And follow the instructions to generate a new pose and save it. This needs to be done every time the part is moved in regards to the robot base.

2. Run the localization node, in terminal 2:
```bash
roslaunch ./react_localizer.launch use_wMo_filename:=$HOME/.ros/transform_wMo.yaml use_oMo_filename:=$HOME/.ros/transform_oMo.yaml use_aligned_depth:=true use_cad_model_filename:=/root/devel/src/react_inria/config/Plaque-UR3.react
```

To use the neural network version of the localizer :
```bash
roslaunch ./react_localizer.launch use_wMo_filename:=$HOME/.ros/transform_wMo.yaml use_oMo_filename:=$HOME/.ros/transform_oMo.yaml use_dnn_localizer:=true use_cad_model_filename:=/root/devel/src/react_inria/config/Plaque-UR3.react
```

3. In terminal 3, launch the script publishing the frame used in the demo, in `agimus-demos/script` folder:

```bash
./publish_frames.py 
```
